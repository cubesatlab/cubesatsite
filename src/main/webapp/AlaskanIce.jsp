      <p>The goal of the Alaskan Ice Buoy project is to develop a buoy that collects
      environmental data from the Arctic and transmits that data back to Vermont. The project is
      also being used to gain experience with <b><a href="http://www.cubesatkit.com">CubeSat
      Kit</a></b> hardware, in hopes of using the CubeSat Kit platform to launch a satellite into
      space as a subsequent project.</p>

      <p>The project was conceived in collaboration with the University of Vermont, which has
      been studying and mathematically modeling arctic sea ice. The ice forms in the colder
      months in the arctic regions, and melts in the spring and summer months. Unlike terra
      firma, this ice is constantly moving and shifting in relation to many variables, such as
      temperature, wind speed, and wind direction. One of the problems that the researchers at
      the University of Vermont have encountered is that they do not have enough data about the
      sea ice to model it completely. In order to better model the mechanics of sea ice, they
      need data to be collected from on the ice itself, which is the goal of the buoy.</p>
